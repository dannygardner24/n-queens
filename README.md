# n-queens
This project is my solution to the famous "n Queens" problem, which challenges a programmer to find the number of permutations in which n queens can be placed on an n x n sized chess board without being able to capture one another. To accomplish this, I wrote classes that represent the contents of a chess board, and used a recursive backtracking algorithms to write methods that would find one solution and find all solutions.
